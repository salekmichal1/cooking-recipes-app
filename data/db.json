Pour 1/4 cup of the pancake batter onto the hot surface for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges look set, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve the pancakes warm with maple syrup, honey, or your favorite toppings.",
